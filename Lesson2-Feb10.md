# Dialogflow - Part 2 

## Follow these steps to replicate the assistant that we saw in the coding club

- Download the intent and entities: [agentzero_intents_and_entities.zip](https://github.com/bringbackthedog/codingclub/raw/master/agentzero_intents_and_entities.zip)  

---

- Then, import it into your dialogflow agent

---

- Enable the webhooks, so your agent can read from the code

- Next, enable the inline editor and copy the content of [agentzero.js](https://github.com/bringbackthedog/codingclub/blob/master/agentzero.js) into dialogflow's inline editor, overwriting any content currently in the editor.  

- And lastly, hit `deploy`

Once deployed, the assistant will be ready availble immediately. Try asking it "What is Superman's alter-ego?".

Feel free to poke around in the inline editor to add jokes.
