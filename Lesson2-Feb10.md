# Dialogflow - Part 2 

## Follow these steps to replicate the assistant that we saw in the coding club

- Download the intent and entities: [agentzero_intents_and_entities.zip](https://github.com/bringbackthedog/codingclub/raw/master/agentzero_intents_and_entities.zip)

- Then, import it into your dialogflow agent [](https://github.com/bringbackthedog/codingclub/blob/master/images/importIntents.PNG)


- Enable the webhooks, so your agent can read from the code

- Next, enable the inline editor and copy the content of [agentzero.js](https://github.com/bringbackthedog/codingclub/blob/master/agentzero.js) in dialogflow's inline editor, overwriting any content currently in the editor.
